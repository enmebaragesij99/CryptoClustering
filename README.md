# CryptoClustering

This is my Module 19- Crypto Clustering challenge, which consists of one CSV file and a jupyter notebook file, which are used in conjunction to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using Python
and unsurpervised learning.

## Contents

- crypto_market_data.csv(CSVfile)

- Crypto_Clustering.ipynb(jupyter notbook file)


## About

-The initial dataset was scaled and converted to a DataFrame, followed by finding the best value of k using the elbow method and the cryptocurrencies being clustered with the K-means.Finally, the scaled DataFrame was optimised using Principal
Componenet Analysis(PCA) creating a new DataFrame with fewer features, followed by finding the best value of k using the elbow method and the cryptocurrencies being clustered with the K-means.
